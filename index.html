            <i>Don't ask if it can be done...Just ask how to do it!</i>
          </p>
          <p>With Drupal there are so many ways you could do <b>it</b>. Often we find ourself comparing various
          metrics of the project and try to decide which contrib module to use. Mostly favouring the highly downloaded ones. Then
          you can check the reputation of the maintainers and aslo look at the release and commit history to get a general idea.
          </p>
          <p>
            Opensource project is all about user involvement. One major way they do is through issue queues. And when it comes to issues, there are so much information to process that it is almost impossible make much sense out of it by manually paging through them and Drupal.org
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to node API exposed by Drpal.Org we can let Drupal do that for us. This <a href="https://github.com/d34dman/drupal-project-health-checker">scrapper</a> collects the data and caches it locally. Then using some love from jquery and d3js provide a very interesting visualization about community involvement in issue queue.

            <strong>Info Cards</strong>
            <span>shows you some key features of the project usage and user involment like total downloads so far, number of issues created by users and the comment responses.
            <br>
            Some arbitary threshold have been used to colour the info cards. Research have to be done to find a proper threshold and
            give a more informative and realistic feedback.
            </span>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <strong>Activity Map</strong>
            <span>helps you visualize the user involvment from arround the world. Unfortunately activity map could only show info
            about users who have provided their location to Drupal.org
            <br>
            Colours used in the choropleth maps is to provide a visual feedback about the density of involvement split according to
            country the users are from. Lighter means less dense and dark means more dense.
            <br>
            It is quite interesting to see the the density differences between user density and their involvement in the project.

          <br>
          <p>
            <strong>User Demographics</strong>
            <span>gives you better insights about who is participating in the issue/comments.</span>
            <br>
            <span><i>Age</i> histogram shows the age of users <small>(as in when they joined Drupal.org and not the actual age)</small> participating in the issues/comments.
            </span>
            <br>
            <span><i>Last Activity Time</i> histogram tells us about the number of users who stopped participating in the issues for past years.
